to login!

You may adjust these names and/or add more by manipulating the backend portion of this same repo group. You can also register a new account yourself. 

After logging in, you will be taken to the main page wih a list of categories our backend has seeded for this project. Each category contains an array of links with titles, descriptions, and favicons. You can add links and categories of your own too! Or, if you decide you take tablessness really seriously, you can delete links as well.
